This repository contains the code necessary to anaylze the experiemnetal videos as well as the raw data from that anaylsis. The raw videos are too large to have on github, if you are interested please contact me at dillonwilliams890@gmail.com

The first experiment uses maincode.py and tracker_sat.py, this code calulctes the saturation and Taylor deformation of RBCs passing through the constriction.

The second experiment uses Strain_Rate.py and tracker_nosat.py. This code calulates the shear modulus of the RBCs passing through the constriction but not the saturation.
